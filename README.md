### The Great Golden Retriever Campaign of 2018
I created a Twilio app that will message my husband, telling him that I think we need a Golden Retriever.
It selects a "random" (not true random, I know, I know) name from a list to suggest.

Also, it doesn't actually text him because his number isn't verified with my trial account, but a girl can dream.

### Thoughts

1. I got an app up and running quickly which was great.
2. The Docs weren't the easiest to navigate. I had a few different tabs open at once and had a hard time jumping between
the documentation relevant to a trial account and the docs that were there for paying customers.
3. I was in the python docs and the code sample showed up as php until I manually changed it. It probably isn't the best
user experience.
4. I am excited to see what else your product can do, which is definitely a good thing!
